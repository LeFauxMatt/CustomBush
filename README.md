# Custom Bush

Custom Bush is a framework mod which allows custom crops to be added to the game
that inherit all of the functionality of Tea Saplings.

- Tea saplings can be planted on untilled ground or in garden pots.
- They continue to produce after reaching an age of maturity.

Unlike Tea Saplings, Custom Bush offers additional options:

- Any number of any items can be dropped.
- The bush sprite can vary based on the item that will be dropped.
- Bushes are able to use game state queries to determine what can be dropped.
- `PlantableRules` can be used to restrict where custom bushes are allowed to be
  planted at.

In general any of the fields that applies to [Fruit
Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fruit_trees) can also apply to
Custom Bushes since they share many of the same attributes.

## Data Format

Refer to [Fruit Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fruit_trees) for
most of the applicable attributes. Additional attributes are explained below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

</table>

The following attributes still work, but were deprecated in favor of
[ConditionsToProduce](#conditions-to-produce):

| Field               | Description                                                                            | Type   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| DayToBeginProducing | The day of the month when the bush can start producing items. Default <code>22</code>. | Number |
| Seasons             | The seasons that the bush can produce items in.                                        | List   |

If you use ConditionsToProduce, these will be ignored.

### Conditions To Produce

Conditions are [Game State
Queries](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries). When the
bush is not carrying an item, it will check each condition, one at a time, from
top to bottom, and stop at the first condition that passes.

Once a condition passes, the bush then produces an item, and saves which
condition passed.

Then every day, it will continue to check that same condition to make sure it
still passes. As long as the condition passes, the item can be collected by the
player.

If the condition ever fails, the item will be cleared out, and the process
repeats.

What this means is that you can group harvests based on conditions. A simple
example is that you can have one condition for spring, and another one for
summer. When an item is produced in the spring, as soon as it changes to summer,
if the item isn't collected, that item will be lost and the bush can reroll for
a different summer item.

### Items Produced

Drops use [item spawn
fields](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Item_queries#Item_spawn_fields).
Additional attributes are explained below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Chance</td>
<td>(Optional) The probability that this entry is selected, as a value between <code>0</code> (never drops) and <code>1</code> (always drops). Default <code>1</code> (100% chance).</td>
<td>Decimal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Season</td>
<td>(Optional) If set, the group only applies if the bush's location is in this season. This is ignored in non-seasonal locations like the greenhouse and Ginger Island.</td>
<td>Text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SpriteOffset</td>
<td>(Optional) An offset to the right of the bloomed sprite to vary the texture based on the item drop that was selected. Each offset is 16 pixels in width.</td>
<td>Number</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Texture

At a minimum, the texture should be a 64x32 image containing 4 16x32 sprites
representing each growth stage of the bush from being planted (first) to being
in bloom (last).

Multiple bushes can share the same texure by increasing the height in 32 pixel
increments, and adding the `TextureSpriteRow` attribute.

If you want to use a different texture for the bloomed bush based on the item it
is currently producing, you can expand the width in 16 pixel increments, add the
additional sprites, and include the `SpriteOffset` attribute on the drop.

## Modify Tea Bushes

You can override the vanilla tea sapling by adding to CustomBush data for it's
item id `(O)251`:

```jsonc
{
  "Format": "2.4.0",
  "Changes": [
    {
      "LogName": "Load the custom bush data",
      "Action": "EditData",
      "Target": "furyx639.CustomBush/Data",
      "Entries": {
        "(O)251": {
          "AgeToProduce": 22,
          "ConditionsToProduce": [
            "SEASON Spring,DAY_OF_MONTH 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28"  // Vanilla harvest period
          ],
          "ItemsProduced": [
            {
              // Add a 50% chance to produce double output
              "ItemId": "(O)251",
              "Condition": null,
              "Chance": 0.5,
              "MinStack": 2,
              "MaxStack": 2
            },
            {
              "ItemId": "(O)251",
              "Condition": null,
              "Chance": 1.0,
              "MinStack": 1,
              "MaxStack": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: If you do this, it will not produce the vanilla tea sapling, so you'll
have to manually add that back as a drop if you want it to still produce that
item.

Unless you specify a texture, the vanilla one will be used. If you want to use
SpriteOffset then you need to also supply the texture.
